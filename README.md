# Project Goal

This project is meant to empower people with the confidence to cook everyday, save money and feel good about it.

It's meant to show that :
* Cooking is not expensive, quite the contrary, it's a creative process to make the most out of every ingredient
* Cooking is not hard, it has an exponentially scaling difficulty but the baseline to feed yourself and others well is very simple
* Cooking is good for your health, if it's your goal
* Cooking will sooth your mind, it's a rewarding experience
* Cooking does not have to be a time consuming process
* Cooking and eating a good meal with your relatives is a healthy social experience it helps you forge bonds and express feelings

Therefore, this software can't be a pain in the ass, it has to be aligned with the same principles at its core.


## Do no harm

### Do no harm to function

Make sure you know it works
* Aim for 100 % coverage with unit testing
* Automate QA
* Trust your test, not your coverage

### Do no harm to structure

Aiming to deliver good function must not comppromise structural integrity
* Don't create unflexible structures, you must be able to make changes without exhorbitant costs
* Always refine the design so that the next change is easier (you can't do that if you don't test it

### Do no harm to end users

* Protect privacy
* Ensure security
* Fix bugs actively
